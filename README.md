# Better TOTD

A TOTD browser with info about your PBs and medals.

Features:

* Easily and quickly find and play any TOTD in Solo.
* View your medals by month, by campaign, or for all TOTDs.
* Filter TOTDs by date, medals, author, track name, TMX tags.
* Sort by date, PB date, track name, author name, # ATs.
* Auto-load new TOTDs the second they become available.
* Integration with [Author-Tracker.socr.am](https://author-tracker.socr.am).
* Quick buttons for tm.io and TMX.
* Great UI & Instant PB loading.

If a map appears to be stuck, you can trigger a reload by loading and exiting that map.

Note: Instant PB loading is experimental, please report bugs. As a backup, your PBs are loaded from the game's API, too (takes about 5 min to full load all PBs).
